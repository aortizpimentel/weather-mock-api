## Features

- Actix Web framework for building the API
- Tracing for logging and instrumentation
- Serde for serialization and deserialization
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Requirements

- Rust 1.54 or higher
- Docker (optional, for deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aortizpimentel/weather-mock-api.git
   cd weather-mock-api
   ```
   
2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
   ```
   
## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
   ```
2. Access the API:
   The API will be available at ```http://localhost:8080/forecasts?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}```.
Replace ```{latitude}``` and ```{longitude}``` with the desired coordinates.

## Docker
### Build and Run with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t weather-mock-api .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 --name weather-api weather-mock-api
   ```
3. Access the API:
   
    The API will be available at ```http://localhost:8080/forecasts?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}```.
Replace ```{latitude}``` and ```{longitude}``` with the desired coordinates.
